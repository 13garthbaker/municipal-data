            <p>This indicator compares how much of a municipality's income it is able to generate itself (through property rates, service charges, etc), compared with how much it receives as transfers and grants from national government.  The more a municipality is able to generate its own income, the more self-sufficient it is.  Municipalities should not be too reliant on transfers and grants from other spheres of government.  If they have to rely on transfers for over half of their total operating revenue it is a clear sign of financial risk.  Municipalities should aim to generate at least 75 percent of their own revenue. </p>
